üîç *Project Overview*: API INTEGRATION AND DATA VISUALIZATION
üéØ *Objective*:
To fetch real-time weather forecast data from a public API (OpenWeatherMap) and visualize the temperature trends using Python libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn.

üõ†Ô∏è *Tools & Technologies Used*: Programming Language: Python API: OpenWeatherMap API Libraries:
requests ‚Äì to make HTTP requests to the API matplotlib.pyplot ‚Äì to create line plots for visualizing temperature trends (Optional) seaborn ‚Äì for enhanced, styled visualizations

üìà *Features*:
Retrieves next 24 hours of weather data at 3-hour intervals Extracts and displays temperature forecasts Uses line graphs to clearly show trends over time Easy customization for any city

üìå *Learning Outcomes*:
Working with REST APIs in Python Parsing JSON responses Data extraction and cleaning Visualizing time-series data Gaining practical experience in Python scripting
